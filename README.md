# Population Statistical Visualization

This is a website that allows for viewing statics about populations of various
country's from 1980-2010 using a series of graphs. The back-end API of the 
website will be built using the Django REST Framework, while the front-end will
be a combination of React and Plotly.js

## File and Directory information

The React and Django REST Framework portions of this project are being built
simultaneously, however they can work completely independently of one another.
As a result they are being held in separate directories.

### Django

All of the Django related files and documentation for this portion of the
project are located in the population directory

### React

The React related files and documentation are all housed in the viewer
directory.

### Data Information
The CSV file found in the Django project's static directory is released under 
the Creative Commons CCZero license for public access and use. This CSV file
has statistics for the population count (in millions) for a variety of
countries around the world from 1980-2010.
